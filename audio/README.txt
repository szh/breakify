This folder contains Apple GarageBand project and MP3 audio files for custom alarm sounds included in Breakify. I'm no expert in this, so these are my improvisations from one Sunday afternoon.
"Meloday" is used as tone_1 and "Odd Techy Mix" as tone_2.
Note: On non OS X systems, as well as in version control, the .band files are treated as directories (similar to OS X '.app' applications).
