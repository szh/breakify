What is Breakify?
=============
Breakify is a simple Android app that reminds you to take breaks.

Why?
---
Because I notice that I'm constantly getting caught up writing code and doing other great things, and I forget to take breaks. That's not too healthy, and I also find that I'm _more productive_ after I take a quick break.

Todo
---
A lot... This is alpha code.
First of all, we need tests. Also still missing lots of other features that I'd like to add. I'm writing this as a fun side project, so I'll get to things whenever I do. If you want to help out though, you're more than welcome to. Keep reading below for instructions.

Building and Running
